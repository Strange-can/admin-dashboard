# admin-dashboard

I will use grid and flexbox to style a webpage that generally looks like <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" >this</a>.

Goals: 
1. Use grid and flexbox to style the page like the image above
2. Practice atomic commits
